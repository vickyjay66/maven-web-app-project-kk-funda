If you want to see which file is consuming the most space in a directory, you can use the following command:

bash
Copy
Edit
ls -lhS
-l → Long listing format
-h → Human-readable sizes (e.g., KB, MB, GB)
-S → Sort by file size (largest first)
If you want to list only the top 10 largest files, use:

bash
Copy
Edit
ls -lhS | head -10
Alternatively, if you want to check file sizes recursively in subdirectories, use:

bash
Copy
Edit
du -ah . | sort -rh | head -10
du -ah . → Display sizes of all files and folders in human-readable format
sort -rh → Sort in reverse order (largest first)
head -10 → Show only the top 10
